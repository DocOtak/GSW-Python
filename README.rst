gswc
====

This is the start of an *experimental* Python implementation
of the Thermodynamic Equation Of Seawater - 2010
(`TEOS-10 <http://www.teos-10.org/>`__) in which the *core*
functionality is obtained by wrapping the functions from the
C implementation (GSW-C).

**Warning: this is in an early development stage.  If it
proceeds, the repo will probably be renamed and moved.**

**Warning: this is presently for Python 3 only.**

**Warning:** the only official TEOS-10 implementations are
provided as zipfiles at <http://www.teos-10.org/software.htm>.

The strategy used here is to use an auto-generated C extension
module to wrap the C functions as numpy ufuncs, and then use an
autogenerated Python module to add docstrings and handle masked
arrays.  157 scalar C functions with only double-precision
arguments and return values are wrapped.

It is expected that some small fraction of the functions implemented
in C will be re-implemented here directly in Python, and that, over
time, many of the functions present in GSW-Matlab will also be
re-implemented here in Python.  In doing so, we would like to
maintain aspects of the approach used so far: factor out common
chunks of documentation, or and/or pull directly from GSW-Matlab,
with automated customization as needed.  In other words, minimize
repetition at the base level of the source code, so that whenever
something can be improved or needs to be updated, it can be done
in one place, and will then be propagated automatically as needed
by the code generation tools.

If this development is successful, it will replace
`python-gsw <https://github.com/TEOS-10/python-gsw>`__ as the
primary Python implementation of GSW.

The eventual names of the repository and of the module it provides
remain to be determined.  For now, the module is named `gswc`
so that it can be installed next to the `gsw` from python-gsw
without conflict, to facilitate development and testing.
Ideally, it will take over the `gsw` name if and when it
becomes sufficiently mature.
